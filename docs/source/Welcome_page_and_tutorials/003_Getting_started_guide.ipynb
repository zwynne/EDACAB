    "[Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) is a cloud-based computational notebook service that provides an online collaborative hub for hosting Jupyter Notebooks and allows users to code directly in their browser in a selected range of coding languages. Deepnote makes it easy to create and share your research methods through combining the readability of traditional written documents with the interactivy of dynamic coding notebooks.\n",
